# Introduction

UngStr√∏m is a collaborative project with NRGi, where the primary business objective of the company was to engage young consumers and strategically retain them through the understanding of their energy consumption needs. The application is designed by a group of students studying a Master's Degree in Digitalization and Application Development. The purpose of the system is to align with customers' preferences, and its features could potentially be integrated into NRGi's existing application.
